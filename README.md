# PiBench [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/pibench/pibench-pipelines/_apis/build/status/wangtzh.pibench?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/pibench/pibench-pipelines/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)
Framework for benchmarking persistent indexes.

# Building
The project comprises an executable binary that dynamically links to a shared library implementing a persistent data structure.

## Dependencies
The project requires c++17 and was tested with gcc 8.1.0 and CMake 3.13.1.

## CMake
CMake supports out-of-source builds, which means that binaries are generated in a different directory than the source files. This not only maintains a clean source directory, but also allows multiple coexisting builds with different configurations.

The typical approach is to create a `build` folder inside the project root folder after cloning it with git:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/wangtzh/pibench.git
cd pibench
mkdir build
```

The `--recursive` option indicates that submodules should also be cloned. To generate the build files, type:
```
cd build
cmake ..
```

A specific compiler can be specified with:
```
CC=<path_to_bin> CXX=<path_to_bin> cmake ..
```

Alternatively, a debug version without optimizations is also supported:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```

Finally, to compile:
```
make
```
# Intel PCM
The tool relies on Processor Counters to collect hardware metrics.
It needs access to model-specific registers (MSRs) that need set up by loading
the `msr` kernel module. On Arch Linux, this is part of the `msr-tools` package
which can be installed through pacman. Then, load the module:
```
modprobe msr
```
It may happen that the following message is displayed during runtime:
```
Error while reading perf data. Result is -1
Check if you run other competing Linux perf clients.
```
If so, you can comment the following line in `pcm/Makefile`:
```
CXXFLAGS += -DPCM_USE_PERF
```

# OpenMP
PiBench uses OpenMP internally for multithreading.
The environment variable `OMP_NESTED=true` must be set to guarantee correctness.
Check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/parallel/openmp/reference/openmp-environment-variables?view=vs-2019#omp-nested) for details.

Other environment variables such as [`OMP_PLACES`](https://gnu.huihoo.org/gcc/gcc-4.9.4/libgomp/OMP_005fPLACES.html#OMP_005fPLACES) and [`OMP_PROC_BIND`](https://gnu.huihoo.org/gcc/gcc-4.9.4/libgomp/OMP_005fPROC_005fBIND.html) can be set to control the multithreaded behavior.

For example:

`$ OMP_PLACES=cores OMP_PROC_BIND=true OMP_NESTED=true ./PiBench [...]`

Note for clang users: you may need to additionally install OpenMP runtime, on Arch Linux this can be done by installing the package `extra/openmp`.

```
The tree data structure implemented as a shared library must follow the API defined in [`tree_api.hpp`](include/tree_api.hpp).
An example can be found under [`wrappers/stlmap`](wrappers/stlmap)

The results are printed to `stdout`.
You probably want to redirect the output to a file to be later passed as an input parameter to plotting scripts (`1>results.txt`).
Also, PCM prints status messages to `stderr` and you probably want to discard them in the resulting file (`2>/dev/null`).
The output looks like this:
```
Benchmark Options:
        # Records: 10000000
        # Operations: 1000000
